# 🧠 Welcome to My Knowledge Stash! 

Hello there! 👋

This repository is my personal knowledge stash, built to keep essential information on hand while I work on HTB machines. No more clutter in my brain with all that info! It may not seem like much now, but I’ll keep adding to it over time. 📚

## 🚀 What’s This About?

This repository serves as a collection of tips, tricks, and knowledge that I gather from various hacking challenges and security learning. The idea is simple: store useful information so I can quickly refer back to it when needed.

I’m still figuring out how to organize everything, but I'm just winging it for now. 🛠️

## 📅 What’s Coming?

- A better structure!
- New insights and tools as I learn more.
- Regular updates and improvements.

Feel free to take a look around, and maybe even contribute if you find something useful or want to add your own tips! 🌟
